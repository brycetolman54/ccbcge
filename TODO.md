# TODO

- [ ] Add more data sets
- [ ] Add info about the data sets other than names to identify them (so people know what the names mean) -> this could be a new array like the others that has longer descriptions of each data set (you would have to add an arg to the showDatasets function or something similar to add the long descriptions after each name
- [X] Add a ref to github about the other paper
